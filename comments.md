1. Can we do each of the steps as an actual step to take? Gradually adding to compose files for instance? Or maybe not each one, but as many as possible. For instance, logging could be a growing compose file
2. ~~context: We need an intro, what is a 12-factor app and why is it important. Refer to https://12factor.net/, which seems to be the canonical site~~
3. ~~Use the same step names as the canonical version i.e. Config not Configuration, Backing services not External services. You can then explain in your own language.~~
4. ~~Also describe the app on the landing page~~
5. ~~Talk about it in terms of Swarm and Kubernetes, how you can deploy on either~~
6. ~~Swarm and Kubernetes have features that might be relevant here, such as rolling upgrades, declarative syntax, easy syntax for shutting down and starting up~~
7. ~~This is a good place to bring up something like kubernetes environment configurations, attaching to remote swarms, client bundles.~~
